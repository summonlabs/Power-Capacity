## Licensing of contributions

By submitting a contribution to this repository you agree that your contribution is
provided under the terms of the Apache License 2.0, without additional terms or
conditions, as described in section 5 of that license. There is no Contributor
License Agreement (CLA) and no copyright assignment requirement. You retain the
copyright to your contribution.

Do not add copyright headers that attribute work to anyone other than the actual
author, and do not add `Co-authored-by` trailers or other attribution trailers to
commits in this repository.

## Building and testing

Requirements: CMake 3.21 or newer and a C++20 compiler. The primary exercised
platform is Windows with MSVC (Visual Studio 2022, toolset 19.44 or newer).

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --config Release
ctest --test-dir build -C Release --output-on-failure
```

The build must be warning-free. First-party warnings are errors: MSVC builds with
`/W4 /WX /permissive-`, other compilers with `-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Werror`.
Do not disable a warning globally to make a change compile; fix the defect or, when
a warning is genuinely wrong for a specific construct, suppress it narrowly at the
site with a comment that explains why.

## Code quality requirements

- Portable C++20. Standard library only; no third-party dependencies.
- Authoritative accounting uses checked integer arithmetic in exact fixed units.
  Floating point is not used for capacity, load, reserve, derating, or any other
  authoritative quantity.
- Every mutation that depends on current state must carry explicit preconditions.
  Stale authority is refused, never merged.
- Observation is not authority. Persisted state is not current evidence. Zero is not
  unknown. Unsupported is not unavailable.
- Persisted and external input is untrusted: bound sizes before allocating, reject
  malformed, truncated, oversized, wrong-version, wrong-endian, and path-manipulated
  state, and never adopt an unrelated store.
- Concurrency changes must preserve the documented lock order (see the concurrency
  section of the README) and must keep the read path free of locks held across
  callback or I/O boundaries.
- Do not claim behavior that is not proven by an executable check in this
  repository. Label real, synthetic, and unsupported evidence precisely.

## Adding tests

Every behavioral change needs a test. Prefer deterministic tests with injected
logical instants over tests that depend on wall-clock time. Property and randomized
tests must use fixed seeds so failures reproduce exactly.
